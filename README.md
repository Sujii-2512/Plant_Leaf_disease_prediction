Plant Leaf Disease Prediction using Deep Learning (CNN Algorithm)

**Overview**
Plants play a crucial role in providing essential resources for humanity, including energy, nutrition, and medicine. However, plant diseases can significantly impact crop production and economic value. Identifying and diagnosing leaf diseases in crops is a challenging task that traditionally requires extensive labor, time, and knowledge of plant pathogens.

This project focuses on leveraging image processing and deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for the automated detection of plant leaf diseases. The goal is to assist farmers in identifying and diagnosing diseases by simply uploading a leaf image to the system. The system employs a set of algorithms to analyze the input image and identify the type of disease affecting the plant.

**Features**

**Image Processing and CNN Algorithm:**
Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks for image analysis.
Processes input leaf images to identify disease symptoms.

**User-Friendly Interface:**
Allows users (farmers) to upload leaf images for disease prediction.
Provides results and disease information through the application.

**Early Detection for Timely Precautions:**
Enables early identification of crop diseases.
Assists farmers in taking timely precautions and countermeasures to minimize losses.

**Cost Reduction and Increased Productivity:**
Reduces the need for extensive pesticide and insecticide use.
Enhances agricultural productivity by facilitating targeted interventions.

**Usage**
**Clone the Repository:**
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-leaf-disease-prediction.git

**Set up the Environment:**
Install the required dependencies and libraries (mention them in a requirements.txt file).

**Run the Application:**
